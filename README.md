# SEM Quantum Device Image Segmentation (Nanotech)

## Overview  
This project focuses on segmenting nanoscale structures in Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of quantum devices using deep learning methods. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system automates complex image analysis tasks, improving accuracy and throughput compared to manual segmentation.

The approach is inspired by recent advances in quantum image processing and classical segmentation algorithms, including seeded-based methods and graph-cut optimization reformulated as quantum annealing tasks.

## Features  
- CNN-based supervised segmentation refined for SEM imaging characteristics  
- Preprocessing and noise reduction geared towards nanoscale feature extraction  
- Seeded segmentation supporting user-defined regions for improved accuracy  
- Modeled on quantum-inspired segmentation frameworks for large data scalability  
- Performance validation against classical segmentation algorithms

## How to Run  
1. Prepare Python environment with dependencies:  
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
2. Organize SEM images into an input folder (e.g., `sem_images/`).  
3. Run segmentation script:  
python segment_sem.py --input_folder sem_images --output_folder segmented_images
4. View segmented output images in `segmented_images` folder.  
5. Optionally, refine seed placements or tune model parameters to improve accuracy.

## File Structure  
- `segment_sem.py` — Main segmentation script utilizing CNN model  
- `trained_model.pth` — Trained CNN model weights file  
- `sem_images/` — Folder with raw SEM images for segmentation  
- `segmented_images/` — Folder where output masks are saved  
- `README.md` — Project documentation  
- `docs/` — Supporting research papers, performance graphs, and logs  

## Methodology Summary  
- Convert SEM images to tensors, applying preprocessing filters to enhance features  
- Utilize a U-Net or similar CNN architecture trained on annotated SEM datasets  
- Employ seeded segmentation to guide model where pixel-wise annotations are sparse  
- Compare results with classical methods such as random walks and graph-cut algorithms  
- Draw on quantum computing analogies for segmentation efficiency and accuracy  

## Future Work  
- Integration with actual quantum annealing devices for segmentation acceleration  
- Expansion of dataset with more annotated SEM images from diverse quantum device types  
- Automated seed generation through AI for user-friendly interaction  
- Deployment of segmentation algorithm as a real-time tool in fabrication lines
